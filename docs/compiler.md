# Compiler

RECSEN language compiler was developed to parse protocol files and automatically generate client-server protocol handlers ontop of TCP/IP for a number of platforms - C++/Linux, .NET and Java.

Client-server protocol handlers produced include features like:

* typesafe message classes
* message dynamic cast operations
* message runtime type information
* typesafe send methods and receive events
* request-response message correlation
* protocol control flow validation
* built-in documentation
