# Compiler

RECSEN language compiler was developed to parse protocol files and generate client-server protocol handlers over TCP/IP for a number of platforms - C++/Linux, .NET and Java.

Client-server protocol handlers produced include features like:

* typesafe message classes
* message runtime type information
* message dynamic cast operations
* asynchronous api
* typesafe send and receive functions
* request-response correlation and closer
* protocol workflow validation
* source file positioning in case of workflow violation
* detailed message logging
* inlined documentation
